## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Install freeipmi.plugin

When using our official DEB/RPM packages, the FreeIPMI plugin is included in a separate package named `netdata-plugin-freeipmi` which needs to be manually installed using your system package manager. It is not installed automatically due to the large number of dependencies it requires.

When using a static build of Netdata, the FreeIPMI plugin will be included and installed automatically, though you will still need to have FreeIPMI installed on your system to be able to use the plugin.

When using a local build of Netdata, you need to ensure that the FreeIPMI development packages (typically called `libipmimonitoring-dev`, `libipmimonitoring-devel`, or `freeipmi-devel`) are installed when building Netdata.


#### Preliminary actions

If you have not previously used IPMI on your system, you will probably need to run the `ipmimonitoring` command as root
to initialize IPMI settings so that the Netdata plugin works correctly. It should return information about available sensors on the system.



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `netdata.conf`.
Configuration for this specific integration is located in the `[plugin:freeipmi]` section within that file.

The file format is a modified INI syntax. The general structure is:

```ini
[section1]
    option1 = some value
    option2 = some other value

[section2]
    option3 = some third value
```
You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](/docs/configuring/configuration#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config netdata.conf
```
#### Options

The configuration is set using command line options:

```
# netdata.conf
[plugin:freeipmi]
  command options = opt1 opt2 ... optN
```

To display a help message listing the available command line options:

```bash
./usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/freeipmi.plugin --help
```

</details>

#### Examples

##### Decrease data collection frequency

Basic example decreasing data collection frequency. The minimum `update every` is 5 (enforced internally by the plugin). IPMI is slow and CPU hungry. So, once every 5 seconds is pretty acceptable.

```yaml
[plugin:freeipmi]
  update every = 10

```
##### Disable SEL collection

Append to `command options =` the options you need.

<details><summary>Config</summary>

```yaml
[plugin:freeipmi]
  command options = no-sel

```
</details>

##### Ignore specific sensors

Specific sensor IDs can be excluded from freeipmi tools by editing `/etc/freeipmi/freeipmi.conf` and setting the IDs to be ignored at `ipmi-sensors-exclude-record-ids`.

**However this file is not used by `libipmimonitoring`** (the library used by Netdata's `freeipmi.plugin`).

To find the IDs to ignore, run the command `ipmimonitoring`. The first column is the wanted ID:

ID  | Name             | Type                     | State    | Reading    | Units | Event
1   | Ambient Temp     | Temperature              | Nominal  | 26.00      | C     | 'OK'
2   | Altitude         | Other Units Based Sensor | Nominal  | 480.00     | ft    | 'OK'
3   | Avg Power        | Current                  | Nominal  | 100.00     | W     | 'OK'

12  | Fan 3A Tach      | Fan                      | Nominal  | 3538.00    | RPM   | 'OK'
13  | Fan 3B Tach      | Fan                      | Nominal  | 2625.00    | RPM   | 'OK'
14  | Fan 1            | Entity Presence          | Nominal  | N/A        | N/A   | 'Entity Present'
15  | Fan 2            | Entity Presence          | Nominal  | N/A        | N/A   | 'Entity Present'
...

`freeipmi.plugin` supports the option `ignore` that accepts a comma separated list of sensor IDs to ignore. To configure it set on `netdata.conf`:


<details><summary>Config</summary>

```yaml
[plugin:freeipmi]
      command options = ignore 1,2,3,4,...

```
