## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Enable the samba collector

The `samba` collector is disabled by default. To enable it, use `edit-config` from the Netdata [config directory](/docs/configuring/configuration), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`, to edit the `python.d.conf` file.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
sudo ./edit-config python.d.conf
```
Change the value of the `samba` setting to `yes`. Save the file and restart the Netdata Agent with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate method](/docs/maintaining/starting-and-stopping-netdata-agents) for your system.


#### Permissions and programs

To run the collector you need:

- `smbstatus` program
- `sudo` program
- `smbd` must be compiled with profiling enabled
- `smbd` must be started either with the `-P 1` option or inside `smb.conf` using `smbd profiling level`

The module uses `smbstatus`, which can only be executed by `root`. It uses `sudo` and assumes that it is configured such that the `netdata` user can execute `smbstatus` as root without a password.

- add to your `/etc/sudoers` file:

  `which smbstatus` shows the full path to the binary.

  ```bash
  netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/smbstatus
  ```

- Reset Netdata's systemd unit [CapabilityBoundingSet](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Capabilities) (Linux distributions with systemd)

  The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using `sudo`, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute `smbstatus` using `sudo`.


  As the `root` user, do the following:

  ```cmd
  mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
  echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart netdata.service
  ```



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `python.d/samba.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](/docs/configuring/configuration#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config python.d/samba.conf
```
#### Options

There are 2 sections:

* Global variables
* One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.


<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Sets the default data collection frequency. | 5 | False |
| priority | Controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard. | 60000 | False |
| autodetection_retry | Sets the job re-check interval in seconds. | 0 | False |
| penalty | Indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures. | yes | False |

</details>

#### Examples

##### Basic

A basic example configuration.

<details><summary>Config</summary>

```yaml
my_job_name:
  name: my_name
  update_every: 1

```
</details>



## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `samba` collector, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `python.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./python.d.plugin samba debug trace
  ```
